1 a ) Year -2005

   i)Changed the title of column to Total Population(Refugees) because only Total Population was confusing.
   ii) Added columns country and origin because only year and population were ambiguous.
   iii) Grouped rows on basis of country of asylum.
   iv) Made the headings(Year, origin etc.) bold and larger font to distinguish.
   v) Center-aligned year, country and origin ; right-aligned total population(numeric) for better readability.
   
   
1 b) Visualised Country, Total male refugees, total female refugees in year 2010. 

Design Rationale - 
	
	i) Used square instead of bars to show very small values(for e.g. 823).
	ii) Sorted in descending order with total number of refugees from a country to list the countries most afftected first.
