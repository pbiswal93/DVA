i 2) Petal Length vs. Petal Width is better at separating classes. 
Sepal length vs Sepal Width graph separates Setosa but 
there is mixing in versicolor and virginica. Petal Length vs Petal Width scatterplot plots 
all 3 classes in different regions.

iii) In log scale plot, the linear plot is converged to a small region.
So, the log scale is better when the data is skewed (possible outliers) 
i.e. some values are very big or very small from bulk of data.
