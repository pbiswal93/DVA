MATCH Query in FTS tables runs faster than LIKE query in normal tables. 

Reasons -
	
	1. FTS tables are built-in full-text index tables thus providing faster query results.
	
	e.g. - 
	
	0,0,0,"SCAN TABLE movie_overview VIRTUAL TABLE INDEX 0:" - LIKE
	0,0,0,"SCAN TABLE movie_overview VIRTUAL TABLE INDEX 5:" - MATCH
	
	2. With MATCH query, complete tokens are searched; LIKE looks for cases where query-text forms part of word.
